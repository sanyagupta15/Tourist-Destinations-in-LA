<p><i>Rodeo Drive is definitely the place to be in Beverly Hills (or even California). You get a sense of stardom as you walk up and down the world famous Rodeo Drive. It has all your designer needs from Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Rolex, Guess - you name it, Rodeo Drive has it.</i><p1>
<p><i>There are some cute, elegant restaurants spotted around where you can people-watch as you sip on a glass of champagne or plan which window-shopping activities you're going to complete next.</i></p>

<h1><strong>Universal Studios</strong></h1>
<h3>https://www.universalstudioshollywood.com/web/en/us</h3>
<p>Universal Studios has made a name for itself as one of the best theme parks to ever go to. They keep a balance of thrill and enjoyment when it comes to food and rides. Universal brings the worlds we love to life like Jurrasic World and the Harry Potter World. It may not have the giant death-defying rides that Knott's Berry Farm has but is certainly one of the best theme parks to be. Not to mention they sell giant donuts.</p>

<p><i>We have wanted to come for many years, many friends explained to us how it works, it was amazing, beautiful unforgettable, what a beauty.</i></p>
<p><i>Went last summer with family - long queues but expected and well worth the wait. Loved every bit of it, especially the The World-Famous Studio Tour where you actually get to see a real movie set as well as how they do special effects!</i></p>
